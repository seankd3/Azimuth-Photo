"""
Elo propagation via embedding similarity.

When a comparison is recorded, propagate scaled Elo adjustments to
visually similar images. This dramatically accelerates ranking for
archives with many similar shots (same scene, same shoot, etc.).

Direct comparisons are always source of truth — propagation only
nudges images that haven't been extensively compared yet.
